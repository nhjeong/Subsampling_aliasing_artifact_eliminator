# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project. It's people like you that make our method such a better tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. We will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into our project itself.


Working on your first Pull Request? 
-> You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.




 Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another


# How to report a bug


When filing an issue, make sure to answer these four questions:

1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

* If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email ICSL.aihelp@gmail.com instead.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Our project is based on the MR parallel imaging method. It was our first trial to reduce aliasing artifacts accompanied with subsampling on phase-encoding axis using multilayer perceptron and L2-loss function. (Please refer to [this paper](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.12600)) However,
